This assignment consisted of implementing and comparing the Sarsa(Î») and the Q-learning algorithm
for a reinforcement learning problem in which our agent, which is placed in a grid world
environment tries to reach a goal state by taking actions (left, right, up or down) starting from
a given start state. The objective of the agent is to maximize its expected cumulative reward.

Please refer to the file [client/agent.py](client/agent.py) for the implementation of the algorithms
