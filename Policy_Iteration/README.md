This assignment deals with finding an optimal policy for a given MDP namely Linear Programming (LP) and three different variants of Policy Iteration (PI): Howard's PI, Mansour and Singh's Randomised PI, and Batch-switching PI. The efficiency of these variants of PI is compared by running a set of experiments.
  
You can find the code for the various methods implemented in the file [solver.py](solver.py).
