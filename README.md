# RL

The `Multi-armed Bandits` folder consists of implementation of various algorithms including epsilon-greedy
exploration, UCB, KL-UCB, and Thompson Sampling for a multi-armed bandit problem.

The `Policy_Iteration` folder consists of algorithms for finding an optimal policy for a given MDP namely Linear Programming (LP) and three different variants of Policy Iteration (PI): Howard's PI, Mansour and Singh's Randomised PI, and Batch-switching PI. The efficiency of these variants of PI is compared by running a set of experiments.
