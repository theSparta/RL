# RL

The `Multi-armed Bandits` folder consists of implementation of various algorithms including epsilon-greedy
exploration, UCB, KL-UCB, and Thompson Sampling for a multi-armed bandit problem.

The `Policy_Iteration` folder consists of algorithms for finding an optimal policy for a given MDP namely Linear Programming (LP) and three different variants of Policy Iteration (PI): Howard's PI, Mansour and Singh's Randomised PI, and Batch-switching PI. The efficiency of these variants of PI is compared by running a set of experiments.

The `Sarsa_Qlearning` folder consists of my implementations of the algorithms Sarsa(λ) and the Q-learning for a reinforcement learning problem in which our agent, which is placed in a grid world environment tries to reach a goal state by taking actions (left, right, up or down) starting from a given start state. The objective of the agent is to maximize its expected cumulative reward.

The `TD_Function_Approximation` consists of my implementation of on-line TD algorithms with linear function approx-
imation on an MDP popularly known as `Baird’s counterexample`.
